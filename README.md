# Prime

TODO: Write intro to prime.

Welcome to prime. This is a tool created to help achieve your goals on a week to week basis.

It is based on the idea that you begin with the end in mind. Considering the context of a year or a decade.

It is meant to be portable, accessible and easy to use.

## How it works?

### Define your roles
Start by defining the relevant roles you play in your life.  A student? A wife? An athelete?

Are you a father? If so, how good of a father are you?
As a human being are you experiencing life as much as you'd like to?

Here is a list example of the roles I play:
* Family member.
* Student.
* Developer.
* Teacher.

### Goals
You should achieve from two to five goals for each role each week. Goals should answer some of this questions:

_What are the things that if I done in a regular basis, would change my life dramaticaly?_

_ What is the one thing I can acomplish, so it makes everything easier or unnecesary?_

_ What can  I do today in order to improve all of my tomorrows?_


Again, here is a list of relevant goals for the week. based on the previous list.

**Family member**
  1. Call my parents twice a week.
  2. Stay in touch with my cousins.
  3. Spend an afternoon with my brother.

**Student**
  1. Read 20 minutes a day.
  2. Deliver my homework for the week.

**Developer**
  1. Write the appropiate tests for my code.
  2. Spend 3 hours a week mastering a new technology.

**Teacher**
  1. Make sure I spend an hour preparing my lessons.
  2. Ask for feedback from my students.
